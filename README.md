# python-interpreter

**a simple python interpreter mainly implemeted by lex and yacc.**
## How to use it?
1. cd ./2019-compiler-lab/
2. make (or you can use ./make or g++ y.tab.c)
3. ./a.out
4. then you can input instructions and MiniPython will operate
5. use CTRL-C or quit() to end MiniPython

## Functions to implement
1. data structure: int,real,string,list
2. arithmetic operation: +,-,*,/
3. operations: append(),range(),print(),len(),list(),etc.
4. index and slices operations for list and string.
5. assignment operation.
6. Others to add...


## Tasks
1. search and collect the syntax of python and list them all together.
2. implement the arithmetic operation of INT and FLOAT
3. design the data structure that is equivalent to list in Python.
4. realize the string with index and slices operation.
5. implement the list with range(),append(),print(),etc.
6. Others to add.
